# Rentfix Maintenance App

React SPA connecting tenants and landlords for transparent maintenance tracking.

## Problem Statement
Tenants struggle to report broken utilities clearly. Landlords can't track repair status efficiently. Communication is fragmented.

## Solution
Centralized platform where:
- Tenants submit issues with photos
- Landlords view and update repair status
- Both parties track progress transparently

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- React Router (SPA navigation)
- Context API (state management)
- localStorage (data persistence)

## Team Structure
[To be filled after role assignment]

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches

## PR Requirements
- One approval minimum
- Descriptive commit messages
- No direct commits to main
